# arrrt
Make art with R! This package contains functions for creating generative art, with simple tuning parameters for controlling colors, sizes, etc.

# Install
Currently you can install using `devtools::install_github('jimtheflash/arrrt')`. The package will hopefully make it onto `CRAN` someday!

# Examples
Most of the functions can be called without any arguments.
